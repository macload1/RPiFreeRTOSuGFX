    \brief Converts IP address in binary representation to string representation

                         For example:
                           - AF_INET for network address IPv4
                           - AF_INET6 for network address IPv6

    \param[out] dst      Pointer to the address string representation for IPv4
                         or IPv6 according to the address family
    \param[in]  size     Specifies the length of the StrAddress_dst, the maximum
                         length of the address in string representation for IPv4
                         or IPv6 according to the address family
