    \brief Create an endpoint for communication

    The socket function creates a new socket of a certain socket type, identified
    by an integer number, and allocates system resources to it.\n
    This function is called by the application layer to obtain a socket handle.

    \param[in] Domain           Specifies the protocol family of the created socket.
                                For example:
                                   - AF_INET for network protocol IPv4
                                   - AF_INET6 for network protocol IPv6

    \param[in] Type              specifies the communication semantic, one of:
                                   - SOCK_STREAM (reliable stream-oriented service or Stream Sockets)
                                   - SOCK_DGRAM (datagram service or Datagram Sockets)
                                   - SOCK_RAW (raw protocols atop the network layer)

    \param[in] Protocol         specifies a particular transport to be used with
                                the socket. \n
                                The most common are
                                    - IPPROTO_TCP
                                    - IPPROTO_UDP
                                The value 0 may be used to select a default
                                protocol from the selected domain and type

    \return                     On success, socket handle that is used for consequent socket operations. \n
                                A successful return code should be a positive number (int16)\n
                                On error, a negative value will be returned specifying the error code.

    \e addr is a pointer to a sockaddr structure. This structure
    is filled in with the address of the peer socket, as known to
    the communications layer. The exact format of the address
    returned addr is determined by the socket's address family. \n

    \brief Set socket options-

    This function manipulate the options associated with a socket.\n
    Options may exist at multiple protocol levels; they are always
    present at the uppermost socket level.\n

    When manipulating socket options the level at which the option resides
    and the name of the option must be specified.  To manipulate options at
    the socket level, level is specified as SOL_SOCKET.  To manipulate
    options at any other level the protocol number of the appropriate
    protocol controlling the option is supplied.  For example, to indicate
    that an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, level should be
    set to the protocol number of TCP; \n

    The parameters optval and optlen are used to access optvalues for
    setsockopt().  For getsockopt() they identify a buffer in which the value
    for the requested option(s) are to be returned.  For getsockopt(), optlen
    is a value-result parameter, initially containing the size of the buffer
    pointed to by option_value, and modified on return to indicate the actual
    size of the value returned.  If no option value is to be supplied or
    returned, option_value may be NULL.
