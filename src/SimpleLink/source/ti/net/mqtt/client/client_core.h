   This module enumerates the public interfaces / API of the MQTT Client
   Library.
 */

#ifndef __MQTT_CLIENT_H__

/**@file mqtt_client.h
   This C library provisions the interface / API(s) for the MQTT Client.

   This is a light-weight library to enable the services of the MQTT protocol
   for one or more client applications (that would typically run on a resource
   constrained system). The key consideration in the design of small footprint
   library has been the abstraction of the low level details of the message
   transactions with the server and yet, provide rudimentary API(s), such that,
   the capabilities and features of the protocol are available to be utilized
   by existing and new applications in an un-restrictive manner.

   The library is targeted to conform to MQTT 3.1.1 specification.

   The MQTT Client library is a highly portable software and implies a very
   limited set of dependencies on a platform. Importantly, these limited
   dependencies are the commonly used features used in the embedded and the
   networking world, and can be easily adapted to the target platforms.

   The services of the library are multi-task safe. Platform specific atomicity
   constructs are used, through abstractions, by the library to maintain data
   coherency and synchronization. In addition, the library can be configured to
   support several in-flight messages.

   The client library supports multiple and simultaneous MQTT connections to one
   or more servers. In this client LIB, the reference to an individual connection
   in conjunction with the associated configuration parameters has been termed as
   a 'context'. Therefore, the client library supports multiple 'contexts'. An
   application that intends to make use of the client library must set-up or
   create a 'context' prior to establishing a connection with the server. The
   application can choose to destroy the 'context' after the connection with the
   server has been terminated. The client LIB can only support a finite set of
   'contexts' and the number can be configured by using a compiler line option /
   flag <b> -DCFG_CL_MQTT_CTXS </b>.

   Once, the 'context' is set-up, the application can send and receive the MQTT
   packets to / from the server. Among several features supported by the client
   LIB, the 'context' manages the keep-alive mechanism by automatically sending
   PING request to the server, if there has been no other packet send to the
   server with the keep-alive duration.

   @note Any future extensions & development must follow the following guidelines.
   A new API or an extension to the existing API
   a) must be rudimentary
   b) must not imply a rule or policy (including a state machine)
   b) must ensure simple design and implementation

        the message. @ref rxpub_help_group

        Depending upon the QoS level of the message, the MQTT client library
        shall dispatch the corresponding acknowledgment (PUBACK or PUBREC) to
        the server, thereby, relieving application of this support.

        If the application completes the processing of the packet within the
        implementation of this callback routine, then a value of 'true' must
        be returned to the client LIB 'context'. The library, in this case,
        does not handover the packet to application and instead, frees it up
        on return from this routine.

        If the application intends to defer the processing of the PUBLISH
        message to a different execution task, then it must takeover the
        ownership of the packet by returning a value of 'false' to the client
        LIB 'context. In this arrangement, the client LIB 'context' hands
        over the packet to the application. The responsibility of storing,

/** Send remaining data or contents of the scheduled message to the server.
    This routine tries to send the remaining data in an active transfer of a
    message to the server. This service is valid, only if the network layer of
    the platform is not able to send out the entire message in one TCP packet
    and has to "back-off" or "give up the control" before it can schedule or
    dispatch the next packet. In such a scenario, the network layer sends the
    first part (segment) of the scheduled message in the mqtt_xxx_send() API and
    the subsequent parts or the segments are sent using this routine.

    This routine is not applicable to the platforms or the scenarios, where the
    implementation of the platform can segment the MQTT message in a manner to
    schedule consecutive or back-to-back blocking socket transactions.
    Specifically, this API must be used by an application, only if the network
    layer can indicate in an asynchronous manner, its readiness to send the next
    packet to the server. And the mechanism to indicate readiness of the network
    layer for the next send transaction is out of band and out of scope for the
    Client LIB and depends on the platform.

    A platform that resorts to partial send of a message and has to back-off from
    transmission implies the following the considerations on to the application.
    (a) The next segment / part of the currently active MQTT packet can be sent
    or scheduled only after receiving the indication, to do so, from the network
    layer.
    (b) The next or new MQTT message (or its first segment) can be scheduled for
    transmission only after receiving the indication for completion of handling
    of the last segment of currently active message.

    @note The application developer should refer to the platform specific network
    implementation for details.

    The routine returns the number of remaining bytes in the message to be sent.
    However, as described earlier, the application is expected to wait for an
    indication about the readiness of the network layer prior to sending or
    scheduling another segment, if so available, to the server. Now, the new
    segment can be a next part of the currently active message or it can be the
    first segment of a new message. A return value of zero means that there is
    no more data left in the scheduled message to be sent to the server and the
    application should wait for an appropriate event to indicate the transmission
    of the last segment.

    In case of an error, the transfer of the remaining segments or parts of the
    scheduled message is aborted. Depending on the configuration of the 'clean
    session' in-conjunction with the revision of the MQTT protocol, the active
    message would be stored for re-transmission, MQTT connection is established
    again. To store a message for re-transmission, at least one segment of the
    message must have been successfully sent to the server.

    @note This API must be used by the application only if the platform has the
    capability to indicate the completion of the sending of an active segment.

    the application. In addition, the invoker of the routine must facilitate a
    place holder to enable the client LIB to provision the reference to the
    'context', so created.

    Specifically, this routine associates or ties-up, in an one-to-one manner,
    the caller provided handle 'app' and the client LIB provisioned handle 'ctx'.
    The parameter 'app' is returned by the client LIB in certain other routines
    to indicate the underlying 'context' with which network transaction or event
    is associated. Similarly, the caller must specify the context handle 'ctx'
    for which the services are being invoked.

    A user or a task prior to utilizing the services of the library to schedule
    MQTT transactions must create a 'context'. A client LIB 'context' can be
    operated in two modes: (a) sync-wait or explicit receive mode and (b) the
    callback mode. Provisioning or absence of the callback parameter in this
    routine defines the mode of operation of the 'context'.

    Explicit receive mode is analogous to the paradigm of the socket programming
    in which an application utilize the recv() function call. It is anticipated
    that applications which would make use of limited set of MQTT messages may
    find this mode of operation useful. Applications which intend to operate the
    'context' in this mode must not provision any callbacks.

    On the other hand, certain applications, may prefer an asynchronous mode of
