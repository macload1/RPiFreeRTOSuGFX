/**@file server_pkts.h
   The C library provisions the interface / API(s) for the MQTT Server Packet LIB.

   This is a light-weight library that enables the services of the MQTT protcol
   for user's server application(s) to exchange the MQTT packets with one or
   more remote clients. The Server Packet LIB is a simple and easy-to-use
   implementation to support both un-packing of the messages received from the
   remote clients and formation of packets to be sent to the remote clients.

   The library is targeted to conform to MQTT 3.1.1 specification.

   The Server Packet LIB is a highly portable software and implies a very limited
   set of dependencies on a platform. Importantly, these limited dependencies are
   common features used in the embedded and the networking world, and can be
   easily adapted to the target platforms. The services of the library are
   multi-task safe. Platform specific atomicity constructs are used, through
   abstractions, by the library to maintain data coherency and synchronization.
   In addition, the library can be configured to support several in-flight
   messages.

   The Server Packet LIB can support multiple and simultaneous MQTT connections
   from clients. However, the responsibility of managing the clients and topics,
   authentication and approval for connections and supporting any other needs
   that specific to the deployment remains with the user application.

   The number of the network connections that the Server Packet LIB can support
   is configurable through the compile line option / flag <b> -DCFG_SR_MQTT_CTXS
   </b>. In addition, the maximum length of the RX buffer used by the server is
   also configurable through the compile line option / flag <b>
   -DCFG_SR_MAX_MQP_RX_LEN </b>.

   @note Any future extensions & development must follow the following guidelines.
   A new API or an extension to the existing API
   a) must be rudimentary
   b) must not imply a rule or policy (including a state machine)
   b) must ensure simple design and implementation

/** <b> Working Principle </b> for implementing the call-back services:
    Implementation of the call-back services should report in return value, only

    follow-up to RX message (represented as a call-back service) need not be
    reported to the server packet library.

    Error observed in TX (supported by appropriate API(s) / services in the
    service packet library) is recorded in the 'context' and shall be dealt in

        connection request that a remote client has made. The application
        should utilize the credential and other data presented by the LIB
        to authenticate, analyze and finally, approve or deny the request.

        Application at its discretion can also imply deployment specific
        policies to make decision about allowing or refusing the request.

        The return value of this routine is a 16bit value that commensurates
        with the 'variable header' of the CONNACK message. Specifically, the
        LSB of the 16bit return value corresponds to the 8bit 'return code'
        parameter in the CONNACK message and the MSB to the 'acknowledge
        flags'. The application must set a valid return value.

        The LIB uses the return value to compose the CONNACK message to the
        remote client. If the LSB of return value is a 'non zero' value,
        then the LIB, after sending the CONNACK message to the remote client,
