 *  @addtogroup ti_net_sntp_SNTP SNTP Client
 *
 *  @brief      The SNTP client provides APIs to synchronize the local time
 *              with a server that provides time synchronization
 *              services using Network Time Protocol (NTP).
 *
 *  There are 3 general use cases supported:
 *      1. You want to use default NTP servers (SNTP_getTime(), with a
 *         NULL server list)
 *      2. You have the string names of one or more NTP servers
 *         (SNTP_getTime(), with your server list)
 *      3. You have the sockaddr of the NTP server
 *         (SNTP_getTimeByAddr(), with your sockaddr)
 *
 *  The SNTP client service will return the seconds passed since
 *  January 1st 1900.
 *
 *  ## Important note on NTP protocol ##
 *
 *  The NTP protocol clearly specifies that an SNTP client must never
 *  send requests to an NTP server in intervals less than 15 seconds.
 *  It is important to respect this NTP requirement and it is the
 *  user's responsibility to ensure that SNTP_getTime() and/or
 *  SNTP_getTimeByAddr() are not called more than once, in any 15
 *  second time period, to contact the same NTP server.
 *
 *  ## Library Usage ##
 *
 *  To use the SNTP client APIs, the application should include its header file
 *  as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/net/sntp/sntp.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  And, add the following SNTP library to the link line:
 *  @code
 *  .../source/ti/net/sntp/{toolchain}/{isa}/sntp_{profile}.a
 *  @endcode

 *  @param[in]  timeout      length of time to wait for NTP server reply
 *  @param[out] ntpTimeStamp time value from server in NTP timestamp format
 *
 *  @remark     @c srvList can be @c NULL to use the default list of NTP
 *              servers.  In this case, @c srvCount must be set to zero.
 *
 *  @remark     If @c srvList is non-NULL, @c srvCount must indicate the
 *              number of servers in the @c srvList array.
 *
 *  @remark     Both IPv4 and IPv6 unicast server addresses are supported
 *              (address is internally resolved).
 *
 *  @remark     If @c srvList is NULL and @c srvCount is zero, a default
 *              list of time servers will be used.
 *
 *  @remark     The caller is responsible for correctly setting @c timeout.
 *              If a value of NULL is passed, the default timeout behavior for
 *              the socket will apply.
 *
 *  @remark     @c ntpTimeStamp contains time values which match the NTP
 *              timestamp specified by RFC 4330. That is, the upper 32 bits
 *              will contain the number of seconds since January 1st 1900,
 *              and the lower 32 bits will contain the seconds fraction. Both
 *              values are unsigned entities.
