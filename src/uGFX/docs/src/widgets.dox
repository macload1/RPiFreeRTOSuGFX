 * @details		Widgets are a "super-class" of a window that provides the
 *				following extra features:
 *				<ul>
 *					<li>Widgets can always redraw themselves
 *					<li>Widgets are able to accept user input such as from a touchscreen/toggle/dial/keyboard
 *					<li>Widgets can have their drawing routine overwritten to provide fancier versions of
 *						the object. For example, their are predefined drawing routines for round buttons,
 *						image buttons, arrow buttons etc. along with the normal button drawing routine.
 *					<li>Widgets support a "style". By changing the style you can affect the colours
 *						used to draw the widget similar to the way you can apply color schemes
 *						in Windows and Linux.
 *				</ul>
 *
 * @pre			GFX_USE_GWIN must be set to TRUE in your gfxconf.h
