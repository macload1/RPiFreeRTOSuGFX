 *
 * @details		The window is the most basic GWIN element. All the other windows,
 *				widgets and containers are based on this class.
 *
 *				A window implements the following properties and attributes:
 *				<ul>
 *					<li>Position</li>
 *					<li>Size</li>
 *					<li>Foreground color</li>
 *					<li>Background color</li>
 *				</ul>
 *
 *				Each Window can either be created statically or dynamically.
 *				Like any other good window system, uGFX provide some standard window
 *				types such as graphs, consoles, buttons, containers etc. This is done
 *				through "super-classing" basic windows to provide the extended capabilities.
 *
 * @pre			GFX_USE_GWIN must be set to TRUE in your gfxconf.h
