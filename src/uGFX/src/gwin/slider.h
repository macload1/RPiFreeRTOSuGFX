 * @param[in] gb		The GSliderObject structure to initialise. If this is NULL the structure is dynamically allocated.
 * @param[in] pInit		The initialization parameters to use
 *
 * @note				The drawing color and the background color get set to the current defaults. If you haven't called
 * 						@p gwinSetDefaultColor() or @p gwinSetDefaultBgColor() then these are White and Black respectively.
 * @note				The font gets set to the current default font. If you haven't called @p gwinSetDefaultFont() then there
 * 						is no default font and text drawing operations will no nothing.
 * @note				A slider remembers its normal drawing state. If there is a window manager then it is automatically
 * 						redrawn if the window is moved or its visibility state is changed.
 * @note				The initial slider range is from 0 to 100 with an initial position of 0.
 * @note				A slider supports mouse, toggle and dial input.
 * @note				When assigning a toggle, only one toggle is supported per role. If you try to assign more than
 * 						one toggle to a role it will forget the previous toggle. Two roles are supported:
 * 						Role 0 = toggle for down, Role 1 = toggle for up.
 * @note				When assigning a dial, only one dial is supported. If you try to assign more than one dial
 * 						it will forget the previous dial. Only dial role 0 is supported.

 * 						The image must be already opened before calling  @p gwinSetCustomDraw(). The image is tiled to fill
 * 						the active area of the slider. The normal colors apply to the border and inactive area and the dividing line
 * 						between the active and inactive areas.
 * 						No checking is done to compare the dimensions of the slider to the size of the image.
 * 						Note text is drawn on top of the image.
 * @note				These custom drawing routines don't have to worry about setting clipping as the framework
 * 						sets clipping to the object window prior to calling these routines.
